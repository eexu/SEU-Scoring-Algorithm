# SEU-Scoring-Algorithm

This page is created to explain the Standardized Results Algorithm of Southeast University.

1. Standardized Results.
   
Assuming the average score of a course is $X$ and your score is $Y$, the Standardized Results is $(Y-X+80)$, which calculates the increment of your score to the average score and adds 80.

2. Weighted Standardise Results.

Weighted the Standatdise Results with credits.

$$
N=\frac{\sum C_i^* N_i}{\sum C_i}
$$

where $Ci$ is the credit of the $i$th course and $N_i$ is its correspongidng Standardised Results.
